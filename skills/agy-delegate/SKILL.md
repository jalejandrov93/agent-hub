## Use `agent-hub`, not this skill directly

Prefer `delegate({agent:'agy', model, task, cwd, mode, ...})` through the `agent-hub` MCP
server. Read `~/.claude/skills/multi-agent-orchestrator/SKILL.md` for the full loop
(`agents_status → route → delegate → job_wait/job_status → job_result → synthesize`), the
break-even rule, and the delegation map. Agy-specific models, health signals, measured
latencies, and gotchas (silent `CANCELED`, `--json-schema` unreliability, `GEMINI.md` not
auto-loaded, `--add-dir` requirement for hosted Claude models) live in
`~/.claude/skills/multi-agent-orchestrator/references/agents/agy.md` — that file is now
canonical; this skill only points to it.

**Read mode is not enforced by agy.** Verified: `agy --mode plan` writes files with or without
`--dangerously-skip-permissions`, so a plan turn can still edit its `cwd`. agent-hub enforces
read mode after the fact — it diffs the git-visible worktree before and after the turn and fails
the job with `errorKind:'read_mode_violation'` — so run agy read/plan turns in a disposable git
worktree. (opencode's plan agent did respect read mode in testing.)

**Never ask agy to run tests/builds/dev servers itself.** Its CLI auto-detaches a slow
`run_command` into a background task and its own idle-exit kills it while still reporting
`SUCCESS` — the work is silently lost. Through the MCP path, agent-hub already prepends a fixed
guard to every agy prompt saying so (write code and an unexecuted RED test only); pass your
verification commands as `verify` on `delegate`/`dispatch` instead and let the hub run them in
the foreground once the job succeeds — see `~/.claude/skills/multi-agent-orchestrator/SKILL.md`'s
"Verification" section and this repo's `docs/verification.md`. The `agy-run.sh` no-MCP fallback
below calls `agy` directly and does **not** get that guard — restate the same instruction in
`--task` yourself when using it.

## No-MCP fallback

If `agent-hub` is not registered in this session, use the wrapper script directly:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/agy-delegate/scripts/agy-run.sh \
  --task "<question>" [--model low|medium|high|pro|sonnet|opus|oss] \
  [--max-lines N] [--timeout S] [--write] [--raw] [--cwd DIR]
```

Aliases resolve to `gemini-3.8-flash-{low,medium,high}`, `gemini-3.1-pro-high` (`pro`),
`claude-sonnet-4-6` (`sonnet`), `claude-opus-4-6-thinking` (`opus`), `gpt-oss-120b-medium`
(`oss`) — check them against your own `agy models` output, since agy's catalog moves over time.
It writes the full response to the scratchpad and prints only a header (`model · seconds ·
tokens · lines · mode`), the file path, and the first `--max-lines` lines; injects
`<cwd>/GEMINI.md` (if <8KB) as project rules since `agy -p` does not auto-load it; and always
passes `--dangerously-skip-permissions` + `--add-dir` (required for the hosted Claude models).
Never call `agy` directly — the wrapper's output contract is the difference between 108s/~27k
tokens and 4s/233 tokens.

> Author's setup (verified 2026-09-11 against agy 1.2.1's `agy models` output): the aliases
> above matched these exact ids.
